                My exhibition revolves around Music and A.I., and how they intertwine. With this exhibition, I wanted to highlight the best aspects of humanity, and why we will always be capable of making better art than Artificial Intelligence.
	In an age of ever-evolving artificial intelligence, art is one thing that humans will always do better. This is because humanity is the most important part of what makes art so unique and enjoyable. The creation of Art is an example of a creative process that humans can partake in. What this means is that no single piece of art is perfect. Since the effectiveness of an art piece is often subjective to the viewer, there is no way to definitively say that an art piece is “perfect”. It’s the human emotions that art pieces draw out of the audience that make art such an enjoyable medium, and nobody is ever going to understand these mediums better than humans themselves.
	In this exhibition, I compiled made from the art that I made in my “Interactive Art” class. At first, I didn’t know what my theme for this exhibition was going to be. I didn’t know how made from the art pieces I chose for this exhibition were connected in any way. I produced each of these art pieces as assignments with due dates and rules to follow, they were not necessarily made from my free will. However, I didn’t realize that throughout the semester, all of my art had to do with both music and Artificial Intelligence. The whole time, I was subconsciously portraying my love for music and my unease around Artificial Intelligence through my art. So, I decided to use my art to portray the humanity in music, and what happens to music when it communicates with Artificial Intelligence.
	I hope you all enjoy it!
