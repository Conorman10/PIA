            <p>
                My exhibition is going to revolve around Music and A.I., and how the two intertwine. The first video I’m going to show is going to be of my composition project, which showcases how AI can react to music to create its art. I wanted to start with this project because while it isn’t my best work, it sets up the rest of what they are going to see. I am then going to include my A.I. commercial, my other two Touch Designer projects from this semester, my explainer video, and a song that I made for another class. It’s a good song, and even though it doesn’t have anything to do with A.I., I feel that it still belongs here.
                Every project I made for this class this year had something to do with music, which is something that I didn’t plan on. It just happened unintentionally. So, it is only right that the intersection between AI and Music should be the theme that my exhibition covers.
                My goal is not necessarily for the audience to learn a whole lot about A.I. or music, but to just enjoy the music itself and what it can create. I want my audience to leave my exhibition with a newfound feeling of enjoyment for music and what it means both sonically and visually. I am thinking about improving my songs a bit to accomplish this feat.
                I hope you enjoy it!
