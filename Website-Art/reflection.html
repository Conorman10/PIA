        <div class="about">
            <p>
                Before putting this exhibition together, I had no idea what I was going to display in it. I hadn’t yet realized that my work throughout the semester all had the same thing in common: Music. I have always known about my love for music, but I didn’t realize that it was so deep that it was manifesting itself within the art I created throughout this semester. So, when it came time to put my exhibition together, I had no problem finding something that tied all my pieces together. But I wanted to dig deeper.
	            Upon reviewing all of my work and what I have been doing in this Interactive media class, I noticed that another theme was emerging that challenged my original theme, that being AI. We had multiple projects in this class where we used AI, and I found that it took some life out of my art. So, I decided to use this exhibition to send a message about my music and how the humanity in it is what makes it enjoyable.
                Thank you all for visiting my virtual exhibition, and I wish you all the best!
